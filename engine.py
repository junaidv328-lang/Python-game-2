=============================================================================

HOW TO USE:
  1. Run this file in Spyder (press F5 or click Run)
  2. The app opens a GUI window
  3. Click "Load Chart Data (CSV)" and select your OHLCV CSV file
  4. The app detects patterns automatically
  5. Each matched pattern shows Bulkowski's statistics + trading plan

CSV FORMAT REQUIRED:
  Your CSV must have columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
  (Column names are case-insensitive)

INSTALLATION (run once in Spyder console):
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy tkinter
